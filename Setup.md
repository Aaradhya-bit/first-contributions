# Setting up Git & GitHub on your computer

This document will help you to setup your computer to use Git & GitHub for your projects.

## Prerequisites
Download & Install Git for your operating system from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Create an account on [Github.com](https://github.com/)

# Method 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
GitHub CLI is GitHub's official open source tool for using GitHub directly from computer's command line & hence provides an easy to use credential system.

## Download & Install GitHub CLI
- WIndows using [Winget (Preinstalled on Windows)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/): 
```bash
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```
> Close & reopen the terminal window after installation for the command to be available
- MacOS via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) : 
```bash
brew install sh
```
- Linux (Ubuntu & other Debian based distros): 
```bash
sudo apt install gh
``` 
- Linux (Fedora & other RHEL based distros): 
```bash
sudo dnf install gh
``` 

## Logging into GitHub account
After installing GitHub CLI, execute the following command to login with your GitHub account
```bash
gh auth login
```
- account type: **GitHub.com**
- preferred protocol: **HTTPS**
- Authenticate Git with GitHub credentials: **Yes**
- Authentication method: **Login with a web browser**

Copy the one-time code provided in the terminal & paste it in the browser window opened for logging in.

ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully connected your GitHub account to Git on your computer. Verify using ```gh auth status```

# Method 2: Using SSH

## Add your username & email to git config

Execute the following commands with your github account credentials to let git know your username & email

```bash
git config --global user.name <YOUR_USERNAME>
git config --global user.email <YOUR_EMAIL>
```

## Set up SSH

Follow the instructions for your operating system.

<summary>For Windows</summary>

### Generating a new SSH key

1. Open Git Bash
2. Paste below text, with your GitHub email address, for generating a SSH key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

3. Accept default choices by pressing enter on prompts
4. You've successfully created your SSH key, next add your key to ssh-agent

### Adding SSH key to ssh-agent

1. Ensure ssh-agent is running by running first line of below text

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
> Agent pid 59566


If you see a similar output, proceed to next step

2. Add your SSH private key to ssh-agent

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Adding SSH key to your GitHub account

1. Copy public key to your clipboard

```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

2. Go to GitHub website and click on your profile photo, then click **Settings**
3. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**
4. Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**
5. In the "Title" field, add a name of your choice for your computer.
6. In the "Key field", paste your public key.
7. Click **Add SSH key**
8. If prompted, confirm access to GitHub account

### Testing your SSH connection

1. Execute the following code in git bash

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

2. If a warning pops up, type yes
3. You should see a message similar to this, with your username

```
> Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access
```

If you see a similar output, proceed to next step

2. If using MacOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

- First, check if file already exists in the default location

```bash
open ~/.ssh/config
```

- If file doesn't exist, create the file

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

- Open the file and modify it to contain the following lines.

```
Host github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

2. Add your SSH private key to ssh-agent

```bash
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Adding SSH key to your GitHub account

1. Copy public key to your clipboard

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

2. Go to GitHub website and click on your profile photo, then click **Settings**
3. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**
